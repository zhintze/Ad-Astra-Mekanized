## System Architecture Overview

The oxygen distribution system consists of three main components:

### 1. **OxygenDistributorBlockEntity** (Improved Version)
- Extends `MekanismBasedOxygenDistributor`
- Uses `OxygenFloodFill` algorithm for smart distribution
- Handles up to 4,100 blocks in a 10-block radius sphere
- Consumes 0.05 mB oxygen per block

### 2. **MekanismBasedOxygenDistributor** (Base Version)
- Simple pathfinding up to 50 blocks
- Uses 0.25 mB oxygen per block (5x more than improved version)
- Implements three-state power system (OFF/STANDBY/ACTIVE)
- Staggered tick updates based on position hash to prevent simultaneous updates

### 3. **GlobalOxygenManager**
- Atomic block claiming system
- Per-dimension block ownership tracking
- Prevents conflicts between multiple distributors
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

## Oxygen Distribution Rules

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
```
1. Start from distributor position
2. Check all 6 adjacent blocks + 8 diagonal blocks (26 total)
3. If NO adjacent air blocks found -> Cannot distribute oxygen
4. Each found air block becomes a seed for expansion
```

### Phase 2: Radius-Based Search
```
INITIAL_RADIUS = 10 blocks (Manhattan distance)
MAX_OXYGEN_BLOCKS = 4,100 (for improved version) or 50 (for base version)

For each position within radius:
  1. Check if position needs oxygen (air or partial block)
  2. Verify path exists from start position (A* pathfinding)
  3. Check GlobalOxygenManager for ownership
  4. If available or already owned -> Add to potential blocks
```

### Phase 3: Flood Fill Expansion
```
From each oxygenated position:
  1. Check all 6 directions
  2. Skip if already visited
  3. If needs oxygen AND not claimed by others -> Add to oxygen zone
  4. Continue until MAX_OXYGEN_BLOCKS reached
```

## Block Detection and Classification

### Blocks That NEED Oxygen:
```java
✅ Air blocks
✅ Stairs (players can walk on them)
✅ Single slabs (NOT double slabs)
✅ Open doors
✅ Open trapdoors
✅ Pressure plates, buttons
✅ Any block with collision shape < 1.0 height
✅ Non-solid blocks
```

### Blocks That DON'T Need Oxygen:
```java
❌ Full solid blocks (stone, dirt, etc.)
❌ Double slabs
❌ Closed trapdoors
❌ Water/Lava source blocks
❌ Blocks with full collision shapes
```

### Oxygen Flow Rules:
```java
canOxygenPassThrough(from, to, direction):
  - Always passes INTO air
  - Blocked by solid full blocks
  - Checks collision shape faces for openings
  - Allows flow through partial blocks
```

## Distributor Collaboration System

### Block Claiming Mechanism

#### Atomic Claiming Process:
```java
synchronized claimOxygenBlocks(dimension, distributorPos, requestedBlocks):
  For each requested block:
    - If unclaimed -> Claim it
    - If we own it -> Keep it
    - If others own it -> Skip (respect boundary)

  Returns: Set of successfully claimed blocks
```

#### Ownership Rules:
1. **First-come, first-served**: First distributor to claim a block owns it
2. **No stealing**: Distributors cannot claim blocks owned by others
3. **Atomic operations**: All claims are synchronized to prevent race conditions
4. **Dimension-specific**: Each dimension has separate ownership maps

### Release Mechanism:
```java
When distributor turns OFF or lacks resources:
  1. Release all owned blocks immediately
  2. Clear from GlobalOxygenManager
  3. Notify nearby distributors (32-block radius)
  4. Other distributors recalculate on next tick
```

### Staggered Updates:
```java
tickOffset = abs((pos.X * 73 + pos.Y * 179 + pos.Z * 283) % 20)
```
- Each distributor has unique tick offset (0-19)
- Prevents all distributors updating simultaneously
- Reduces server lag and claiming conflicts

### Priority System:
```java
activationTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
```
- Tracks when each distributor activated
- Could be used for priority-based claiming (currently unused)

## Resource Management

### Three-State Power System

#### State 0: INACTIVE (OFF)
- Manually disabled by player
- No oxygen distribution
- No resource consumption
- Releases all claimed blocks immediately

#### State 1: STANDBY
- Enabled but lacks resources
- Waiting for energy/oxygen
- No active distribution
- Releases all claimed blocks

#### State 2: ACTIVE
- Has sufficient energy AND oxygen
- Actively distributing oxygen
- Consuming resources every 100 ticks (~5 seconds)

### Resource Consumption Rates

#### Improved Distributor (OxygenDistributorBlockEntity):
```
Energy: 400 FE per distribution cycle
Oxygen: 0.05 mB per block per cycle
Capacity: 2,000 mB oxygen, 30,000 FE
Coverage: Up to 4,100 blocks
```

#### Base Distributor (MekanismBasedOxygenDistributor):
```
Energy: 400 FE per distribution cycle
Oxygen: 0.25 mB per block per cycle (5x more!)
Capacity: 2,000 mB oxygen, 30,000 FE
Coverage: Up to 50 blocks
```

### Distribution Interval:
```
Base interval: 100 ticks (5 seconds)
Adjusted: 100 + tickOffset (5-6 seconds)
Visualization update: Every 20 ticks (1 second)
```

## Current Limitations

### 1. Fixed Maximum Radius
- Hard-coded 10-block initial radius
- Cannot expand beyond MAX_OXYGEN_BLOCKS limit
- No dynamic adjustment based on available resources

### 2. Block Claiming Conflicts
- Binary ownership (owned or not owned)
- No sharing or overlap between distributors
- Can create "dead zones" between distributors

### 3. Performance Bottlenecks
- A* pathfinding for EVERY block in radius
- Full recalculation every distribution cycle
- No caching of valid paths

### 4. Edge Cases
- Distributors can block each other's expansion
- No cooperative zone merging
- No priority for central vs. peripheral blocks

### 5. Resource Inefficiencies
- Fixed consumption rates regardless of actual need
- No gradual expansion based on available oxygen
- All-or-nothing distribution model

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Dynamic Radius Expansion
```java
// Start small, expand gradually
currentRadius = min(initialRadius + (ticksSinceActivation / 200), maxRadius)
maxBlocks = min(availableOxygen / oxygenPerBlock, MAX_OXYGEN_BLOCKS)
```

### 2. Cooperative Zone Merging
```java
// Allow distributors to share border blocks
class SharedOxygenZone {
  Set<BlockPos> distributors;  // Multiple owners
  int priority;  // Based on activation time
  float oxygenContribution;  // Split cost
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Pathfinding Cache
```java
// Cache valid paths for 100 ticks
Map<BlockPos, PathResult> pathCache;
if (tickCounter % 100 == 0) {
  pathCache.clear();  // Refresh periodically
}
```

### 4. Priority-Based Claiming
```java
// Prefer blocks closer to distributor
PriorityQueue<BlockPos> claimQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(
  (a, b) -> Integer.compare(
    a.distManhattan(distributorPos),
    b.distManhattan(distributorPos)
  )
);
```

### 5. Gradual Expansion Algorithm
```java
// Expand one "ring" at a time
for (int ring = 1; ring <= maxRadius && blocks < maxBlocks; ring++) {
  Set<BlockPos> ringBlocks = getBlocksAtDistance(ring);
  // Claim available blocks in this ring before moving outward
}
```

### 6. Collaborative Coverage Algorithm
```java
// Distributors communicate to maximize coverage
class CollaborativeOxygenSystem {
  // Phase 1: Each distributor claims core area (radius 5)
  // Phase 2: Negotiate border zones
  // Phase 3: Fill gaps cooperatively

  void negotiateBorders(List<OxygenDistributor> neighbors) {
    // Find overlap zones
    // Assign based on distance + resources
    // Share oxygen cost proportionally
  }
}
```

### 7. Performance Optimizations
```java
// Batch operations
Set<BlockPos> allChanges = new HashSet<>();
for (OxygenDistributor dist : allDistributors) {
  allChanges.addAll(dist.calculateChanges());
}
GlobalOxygenManager.applyBatch(allChanges);

// Use chunk-based updates
updateByChunk(Set<ChunkPos> affectedChunks);
```

### 8. Smart Resource Management
```java
// Adjust consumption based on actual coverage
float efficiencyFactor = actualBlocks / potentialBlocks;
float adjustedConsumption = baseConsumption * (0.5 + 0.5 * efficiencyFactor);

// Gradual shutdown when low on resources
if (oxygenLevel < 20%) {
  reduceRadius(0.9f);  // Shrink coverage to conserve
}
```

## Conclusion

The current oxygen distribution system is functional but has room for significant optimization. The main areas for improvement are:

1. **Performance**: Reduce redundant calculations through caching
2. **Cooperation**: Allow distributors to work together rather than compete
3. **Efficiency**: Dynamic adjustment based on available resources
4. **Coverage**: Minimize dead zones through intelligent claiming

By implementing these optimizations in phases, the system can achieve:
- **50-70% better performance** through caching and batching
- **20-30% better coverage** through cooperation
- **More realistic oxygen flow** through gradual expansion
- **Better player experience** through smoother distribution

The key is to maintain backward compatibility while gradually introducing these improvements, testing each phase thoroughly before moving to the next.
