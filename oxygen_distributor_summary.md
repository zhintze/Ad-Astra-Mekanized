# Oxygen Distributor Improvements Summary

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Visual Rendering System
- **Ice-like appearance**: Changed from yellow-greenish to cyan/ice blue (R:0.8, G:0.95, B:1.0)
- **Increased visibility**: Alpha increased from 0.15 to 0.25 for better visibility
- **Smart face rendering**: Only renders exposed faces (not adjacent to other oxygen blocks)
- **Reduced z-fighting**: Added 0.002f inset to prevent visual artifacts
- **Show/Hide button**: GUI toggle for oxygen zone visualization

### 2. Expanded Oxygen Distribution
- **10-block radius sphere**: Increased from 100 to 4,100 blocks maximum
- **Reduced consumption**: Decreased from 0.1 to 0.05 mB per block
- **Smart flood fill**: Respects walls and requires adjacent air blocks to start

### 3. Code Cleanup
- **Removed old debug commands**: Deleted unused OxygenDebugCommand
- **Fixed network packets**: Resolved duplicate registration issues
- **Improved rendering**: Added proper UV coordinates and lighting

## Configuration

### Current Settings
```java
// Maximum oxygen blocks (10-block radius sphere)
MAX_OXYGEN_BLOCKS = 4100

// Oxygen consumption rate
OXYGEN_PER_BLOCK = 0.05f // mB per block

// Visual settings
RED = 0.8f    // Light cyan
GREEN = 0.95f  // Light cyan
BLUE = 1.0f   // Full blue (ice tint)
ALPHA = 0.25f // 25% opacity
```

### Testing Instructions
1. Place oxygen distributor
2. Connect Mekanism oxygen pipes
3. Activate distributor
4. Click "Show/Hide Oxygen" button in GUI
5. Observe ice-like translucent blocks filling up to 10-block radius
