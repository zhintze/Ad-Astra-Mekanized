# Oxygen Distribution Improvements - 3x3 Priority Cube

## Changes Made

### 1. More Transparent Debug Blocks
- **Changed alpha from 0.5 to 0.15** in OxygenZoneRenderer
- Debug blocks are now much more subtle and transparent
- Colors still visible but don't obscure gameplay

### 2. 3x3x3 Priority Cube Claiming
Each oxygen distributor now **immediately claims a 3x3x3 cube** around itself before expanding outward.

**Benefits:**
- Distributors have guaranteed control over their immediate surroundings
- Prevents other distributors from claiming right next to them
- More realistic oxygen flow (starts from all sides, not just top)
- Better for enclosed spaces where distributor is against walls

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Priority Cube Algorithm (ImprovedOxygenFloodFill.java)
```java
// PRIORITY PHASE: Immediately claim 3x3x3 cube around distributor
for (int dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
    for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
        for (int dz = -1; dz <= 1; dz++) {
            BlockPos cubePos = distributorPos.offset(dx, dy, dz);
            // Skip the distributor itself
            if (!cubePos.equals(distributorPos)) {
                // Try to claim with priority
                if (canClaimPosition(...)) {
                    oxygenatedPositions.add(cubePos);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Claims up to 26 blocks immediately (3x3x3 minus center)
- These blocks serve as expansion points for further growth
- If ALL 26 blocks are blocked, distributor cannot function
- Respects ownership - won't steal from other distributors

### 4. Testing Instructions

#### Test 1: Basic 3x3 Cube
1. Place a distributor in open air
2. Provide energy and oxygen
3. Enable visualization
4. **Expected**: See immediate 3x3x3 cube of oxygen around distributor
5. **Expected**: Cube then expands outward from all sides

#### Test 2: Corner Placement
1. Place distributor in corner of room (touching 3 walls)
2. Activate with resources
3. **Expected**: Only claims air blocks in the 3x3 cube
4. **Expected**: Expands from available sides

#### Test 3: Distributor Spacing
1. Place two distributors 4 blocks apart
2. Activate both
3. **Expected**: Each has its own 3x3 cube
4. **Expected**: They meet in the middle without overlap

#### Test 4: Tight Spaces
1. Place distributor in 3x3x3 room (fills entire room)
2. Activate
3. **Expected**: Entire room becomes oxygenated immediately
4. **Expected**: No further expansion possible

### 5. Visual Improvements

**Alpha Transparency**: 0.15 (was 0.5)
- 70% more transparent than before
- Subtle ice-like appearance
- Colors still distinguishable:
  - Cyan (default)
  - Red
  - Green
  - Yellow
  - Magenta
  - Blue

### 6. Debug Command
```
/oxygen debug
```
Shows:
- Current radius
- Priority cube blocks claimed
- Total oxygenated blocks
- Efficiency percentage

## Summary

The oxygen distribution system now:
1. **Starts with 3x3x3 priority cube** - guaranteed control zone
2. **Expands from all claimed blocks** - more natural spread
3. **Uses 85% transparent blocks** - less visual obstruction
4. **Respects boundaries** - no stealing between distributors
5. **Works in tight spaces** - effective even when constrained

This creates a more realistic and visually appealing oxygen distribution system that gives each distributor immediate control over its surroundings while maintaining the dynamic expansion system.
