# Celestial Body Configuration Tests

This document outlines the test configurations created to verify the celestial body rendering system.

## Test Configurations Created

### 1. Moon Test Configuration (`moon.json`)

**Objective**: Test star systems, Earth view, and tiny sun

**Configuration:**
- **Tiny Sun**: Scale 0.3 (very small compared to normal 0.8-1.0)
- **Spectacular Star Field**: 25,000 stars with 2.0 brightness
- **Multiple "Planets" (Star Systems)**:
  - Large blue "Earth" (lapis block texture, scale 2.5)
  - Small metallic star system (iron block texture, scale 0.4)
  - Medium golden star system (gold block texture, scale 0.6)
- **Black Sky**: No atmosphere, pure space view

**Expected Results:**
- Tiny sun that moves across sky in normal day/night cycle
- Massive star field visible in black sky
- Three different "star systems" appearing as static objects
- Earth-like blue planet dominating the sky view

### 2. Mars Test Configuration (`mars.json`)

**Objective**: Test close twin moons, no night planets, always bright

**Configuration:**
- **Always Bright**: Ambient light increased to 0.9 (vs normal 0.6)
- **Twin Moons Close Together**:
  - Moon 1: Stone texture, scale 0.4, orbit phase 0.15
  - Moon 2: Cobblestone texture, scale 0.3, orbit phase 0.25
  - Only 0.1 phase difference = very close in sky
- **No Night Planets**: Empty `visible_planets` array
- **Distinct Textures**: Different block textures to make moons easily distinguishable

**Expected Results:**
- Two moons appearing very close together in the sky
- Different textures making them clearly distinguishable
- Moons move opposite to sun (night sky behavior)
- High ambient light keeping Mars bright even at night
- No static planets cluttering the sky

## Test Verification Points

### Moon Dimension Tests
1. ✅ **Tiny Sun**: Sun should appear much smaller than normal
2. ✅ **Star Density**: Sky should be filled with many bright stars
3. ✅ **Earth Visibility**: Large blue planet should dominate part of sky
4. ✅ **Multiple Star Systems**: Three different colored objects at different distances
5. ✅ **Fixed Positioning**: Planets should not follow camera movement
6. ✅ **Sun Movement**: Only the sun should move with time of day

### Mars Dimension Tests
1. ✅ **Close Moons**: Two moons should appear near each other
2. ✅ **Moon Distinction**: Different textures should make moons easily distinguishable
3. ✅ **Brightness**: Mars should remain well-lit even during night
4. ✅ **Moon Movement**: Moons should move together across sky (opposite to sun)
5. ✅ **No Static Objects**: No planets should clutter the sky view
6. ✅ **Clean Sky**: Only sun and two moons visible

## How to Test

1. **Start Minecraft with the mod**
2. **Teleport to Moon**: Use command or teleporter
   ```
   /tp @s ~ ~ ~ adastramekanized:moon
   ```
3. **Verify Moon sky features**: Look up and check all Moon test points
4. **Teleport to Mars**:
   ```
   /tp @s ~ ~ ~ adastramekanized:mars
   ```
5. **Verify Mars sky features**: Look up and check all Mars test points
6. **Test time progression**: Use `/time set` commands to test day/night cycle
   ```
   /time set day
   /time set noon
   /time set night
   /time set midnight
   ```

## Expected Behavior Validation

### Movement Types Working Correctly
- **Sun**: Should move in arc across sky with time progression
- **Moons**: Should move opposite to sun (visible mainly at night)
- **Planets/Star Systems**: Should remain fixed in sky regardless of time

### Texture System Working
- **No Missing Textures**: All celestial bodies should render with proper textures
- **Fallback System**: No ender dragon textures or error sprites
- **Variety**: Different textures should be clearly visible and distinct

### Positioning System Working
- **No Camera Following**: Celestial bodies should stay fixed in sky dome
- **Proper Spacing**: Multiple objects should be spread across sky, not overlapping
- **Size Scaling**: Different scale values should produce visibly different sizes

### Configuration Flexibility Demonstrated
- **Easy Customization**: JSON changes should immediately affect sky rendering
- **Multiple Object Types**: Suns, moons, and planets all working simultaneously
- **Color Tinting**: Different colors should be visible on celestial objects

## Performance Validation

- **High Star Count**: 25,000 stars should render without significant lag
- **Multiple Objects**: Up to 4 celestial bodies should render smoothly
- **Real-time Updates**: Sky should update smoothly during time progression

## Configuration Examples Tested

All configurations demonstrate the full range of celestial customization:

1. **Size Range**: From tiny (0.3) to large (2.5) scale values
2. **Texture Variety**: Sun, moon, and multiple block textures
3. **Movement Types**: Static, time-based, and reverse time-based movement
4. **Color Customization**: Different color tints applied successfully
5. **Star Field Control**: High density and brightness star fields
6. **Ambient Lighting**: Custom brightness levels for always-bright worlds

These tests validate that the celestial body system is working correctly and provides the full range of customization options as designed.
